### Audio AI @ Dolby Laboratories
I lead the Audio AI team, creating state-of-the-art Audio and Speech technologies and developing an AI strategy for Dolby. In the past few years, we have significantly improved [speech compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03021) and created novel [voice conversion](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/1121.html) techniques by combining Deep Learning with audio expertise and understanding of human perception

Before this, I led the development of Dolby's core codecs ([Dolby Digital  Plus](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital-plus.html) & [Dolby TrueHD](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-truehd.html) ) and created technologies for [Dolby Atmos](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/home/dolby-atmos.html). 

### Angel Investor
As an angel investor, I have also invested in several early-stage ventures and provide mentoring and strategy development for startups. This has given me the opportunity to work with visionary entrepreneurs and has given me a  perspective of developments and breakthroughs across industries.
