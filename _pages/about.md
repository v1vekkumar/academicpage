### Audio AI @ Dolby Laboratories
I lead the AI team, develop Audio and Speech technologies, and build AI strategy for Dolby. In the past few years, we have developed state-of-the-art [speech compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03021) and created novel [voice conversion](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/1121.html) techniques by combining our Deep Learning expertise, audio experience, and understanding of human perception.

Before this, I led the development of Dolby's core codecs ([Dolby Digital Plus](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital-plus.html) & [Dolby TrueHD](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-truehd.html)) and created technologies for [Dolby Atmos](https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/home/dolby-atmos.html). 

### Angel Investor
I invest and help with strategy development for early-stage ventures. Engaging with visionary entrepreneurs has helped me understand developments and breakthroughs across industries.
