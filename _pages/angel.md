## Investment Thesis 

I focus on startups with speculative technologies and a founding team with passion and capability to disrupt the status quo. 
Innovative companies that cross the technical uncertainty chasm and create disruptive technology end up controlling their destinies. That is what I hope to help founders build. 

Trends I am excited about:
* **Democratization of Technology**: The transition to a bottom-up economy and democratization of technology is creating opportunities across industries.  As [software continues to eat the world], a trend that continues with mobile access and AI presents opportunities for innovative startups to disrupt across verticals and lead for years to come.

* **Attention Economy**:  Time is the most valuable skill we have in the [attention economy], and I am incredibly positive about the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to simplify our lives
